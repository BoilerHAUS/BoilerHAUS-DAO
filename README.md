## **2. Introduction**

### **2.1 Overview of ZeroPoint DAO**

ZeroPoint DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that owns and manages a portfolio of real-world assets (RWAs) through specialized entities known as BORGs (Blockchain Organized Recursive Guilds). By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and autonomous governance, ZeroPoint DAO seeks to:

- Democratize access to asset ownership.
- Enhance transparency and efficiency in asset management.
- Align incentives among stakeholders through tokenomics.
- Foster innovation through integration with advanced protocols.

### **2.2 Challenges in Real-World Asset Management**

- **Centralization:** Traditional asset management is often centralized, limiting participation and control to a few entities.
- **Inefficiency:** Manual processes and intermediaries increase costs and slow down operations.
- **Legal Complexity:** Navigating regulations across jurisdictions is challenging and risky.
- **Transparency Issues:** Lack of visibility into operations and decision-making erodes trust.
- **Asset Diversity Management:** Different asset classes require specialized management approaches, adding complexity.

### **2.3 The Cyberpunk Influence**

ZeroPoint DAO embraces the cyberpunk ethos, characterized by a blend of high-tech innovation and countercultural rebellion. This influence manifests in:

- **Aesthetic and Branding:** Utilizing futuristic and edgy themes to create a unique identity.
- **Philosophy:** Challenging traditional norms and promoting decentralization and individual empowerment.
- **Innovation:** Pushing the boundaries of technology to create new possibilities in asset management.

## **3. ZeroPoint DAO Architecture**

### **3.1 Structure of ZeroPoint DAO**

ZeroPoint DAO serves as the overarching entity that coordinates and governs multiple BORGs. Each BORG operates semi-independently under the DAO's umbrella, focusing on specific asset classes or operational functions. This structure allows for:

- **Specialization:** BORGs can tailor their operations to the unique requirements of their assigned assets.
- **Scalability:** The DAO can add new BORGs to manage additional assets or functions as it grows.
- **Diverse Asset Management:** The DAO can own and manage a wide range of RWAs, such as data centers, renewable energy facilities, real estate, or intellectual property.

### **3.2 BORGs and Their Functions**

Each BORG within ZeroPoint DAO has a singular focus, enabling:

- **Dedicated Management:** Specialized teams and resources for specific assets.
- **Legal Compliance:** Tailored legal structures to meet the regulatory requirements of different asset types.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Isolating risks within each BORG to protect the DAO and other BORGs.

**Examples of BORG Functions:**

- **DataBORG:** Manages modular data centers.
- **EnergyBORG:** Focuses on renewable energy assets.
- **RealtyBORG:** Handles real estate investments.
- **IPBORG:** Manages intellectual property assets.

### **3.3 Integration of Code and Law**

ZeroPoint DAO meticulously aligns smart contract functions with legal agreements to ensure:

- **Enforceability:** Outcomes of smart contracts are legally recognized and binding.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Legal mechanisms override code in defined scenarios to address failures or unforeseen issues.
- **Accountability:** Off-chain actors are held responsible through legal obligations outlined in contracts.

---

## **4. Governance Model**

### **4.1 Decentralized Decision-Making**

ZeroPoint DAO employs a multi-layered governance system based on the Moloch DAO framework via DAOhaus:

- **DAO-Level Governance:** Oversees the overall direction, policies, and coordination among BORGs.
- **BORG-Level Governance:** Each BORG operates as a sub-DAO with its own governance structure tailored to its specific function and asset requirements.
- **Member Participation:** Members can participate in governance at both the DAO and BORG levels, depending on their holdings and interests.

### **4.2 Roles and Responsibilities**

Utilizing Hats Protocol, roles within ZeroPoint DAO are represented as programmable, revocable, and legible "hats" (ERC-1155 tokens):

- **DAO Members (Top Hats):** Token holders who participate in overarching governance decisions.
- **BORG Members:** Participants who hold tokens specific to a BORG and engage in its governance.
- **BORG Operators:** Agents responsible for the day-to-day operations of a specific BORG.
- **Multisig Signers:** Trusted individuals controlling critical transactions within BORGs or the DAO.
- **Emergency Supervisors:** Appointed to intervene legally in case of misconduct or emergencies within a BORG.

### **4.3 Voting Mechanisms**

- **DAO-Level Voting:** Addresses proposals affecting the entire organization, such as adding new BORGs or changing governance policies.
- **BORG-Level Voting:** Focuses on decisions specific to a BORG, such as asset acquisitions or operational changes.
- **Token-Based Voting:** Members vote proportionally to their token holdings in the relevant DAO or BORG.
- **Quadratic Voting:** May be implemented to ensure fairness and prevent dominance by large holders.
